## Implementation Strategy

### Development Approach

- Implement features in vertical slices (UI + logic + external integration)
- Focus on getting basic functionality working before refinement
- Use dependency injection to facilitate testing and component replacement
- Follow the interface guidelines established in the architecture design

### Version Milestones

1. **v0.1 (Alpha)**: Basic search functionality and results display
2. **v0.2**: Car data integration and matching algorithm
3. **v0.3**: Scoring system and detailed views
4. **v0.4**: LLM integration and analysis features
5. **v0.5 (Beta)**: Complete settings and configuration
6. **v1.0**: Fully tested and refined application

### Dependencies Management

- Continue using UV for package management
- Document all external dependencies in requirements.txt
- Pin specific versions to ensure reproducibility
- Check for security updates regularly

## Technical Debt Management

To avoid accumulating technical debt, we will:

1. Refactor any temporary solutions before moving to the next phase
2. Maintain comprehensive documentation for all components
3. Address linting errors and code quality issues promptly
4. Review and update tests when modifying existing functionality
5. Schedule regular code review sessions

## Definition of Done

Each task is considered complete when:

1. Code is written according to project style guidelines
2. Functionality works as specified in design documents
3. Tests cover the new functionality
4. Documentation is updated
5. Code passes all linting and quality checks
6. Changes are reviewed by another developer
