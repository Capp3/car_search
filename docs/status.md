# Project Status

This document tracks the current status of the Car Search project, including active work, recent achievements, and known issues.

## Current Sprint (2023-08-10 to 2023-08-17)

### Focus Areas

1. **Browser Automation Migration**
   - Migrating from HTTP-based scraping to Playwright browser automation
   - Creating resilient selectors and interactive element handling
   - Implementing debugging tools (screenshots, console logging)

2. **Car Matching Algorithm**
   - Developing text normalization for car make/model matching
   - Creating similarity scoring for connecting search results to reliability data
   - Implementing confidence metrics for matches

## Known Issues

| Issue                                        | Priority | Status          | Notes                                 |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| AutoTrader scraping occasionally blocked     | High     | Being addressed | Browser automation will help mitigate |
| API rate limits reached during heavy usage   | Medium   | Being addressed | Implementing better caching           |
| UI freezes during long-running operations    | Medium   | Not started     | Will add background processing        |
| Incorrect car matching for some makes/models | Medium   | In progress     | New algorithm in development          |

## Blockers

No critical blockers at this time.

## Next Meeting Topics

1. Demo of Playwright browser automation progress
2. Discussion of car matching algorithm approach
3. Planning for LLM integration timeline
4. Review of UI performance issues
