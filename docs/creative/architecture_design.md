## Recommended Approach

After analyzing the options, Option 1 (Layered Architecture with Functional Modules) is recommended for the Car Search application for the following reasons:

1. **Alignment with Current Structure**: The project has already started with this architectural approach, and maintaining consistency would be beneficial.

2. **Balance of Concerns**: It provides a good balance between separation of concerns and development efficiency.

3. **Team Familiarity**: This pattern is widely used and understood, making it easier for developers to contribute.

4. **Appropriate Complexity Level**: It offers sufficient structure without adding unnecessary complexity for the scale of this application.

5. **Support for Planned Features**: The structure adequately supports the planned features and extensions.

To address the potential downsides:

- Carefully manage dependencies to prevent circular imports
- Establish clear interface boundaries between modules
- Use dependency injection to improve testability
- Document the architecture and module responsibilities

## Implementation Guidelines

### Module Structure

Follow the outlined directory structure:

```
car_search/
â”œâ”€â”€ ui/              # Qt6 UI components
â”œâ”€â”€ core/            # Core application logic
â”œâ”€â”€ search/          # Search and web scraping
â”œâ”€â”€ data/            # Car data integration
â”œâ”€â”€ llm/             # LLM integration
â””â”€â”€ config/          # Configuration management
```

### Interface Guidelines

1. **UI Interfaces**:
   - Each UI component should accept data models and emit signals for user actions
   - UI should not directly interact with external services
   - Use dependency injection for business logic components

2. **Business Logic Interfaces**:
   - Define clear service interfaces for each business domain
   - Use Python's abstract base classes or protocols for interface definitions
   - Implement proper error handling and logging

3. **External Integration Interfaces**:
   - Create abstract base classes for external services
   - Implement concrete adapter classes for specific external services
   - Use dependency injection to enable easy switching between implementations

### Data Flow Guidelines

1. **User Interaction Flow**:
   - UI captures user input
   - UI sends input to core services
   - Core services process input and interact with external services
   - External services return data to core services
   - Core services process and transform data
   - UI displays processed data to the user

2. **Configuration Flow**:
   - Configuration is loaded at application startup
   - Components request configuration from the configuration manager
   - Changes to configuration are propagated through the configuration manager

3. **Error Handling Flow**:
   - External services capture and translate external errors
   - Core services handle business logic errors
   - UI displays appropriate error messages to the user

### Implementation Example

Here's an example of how the interfaces between modules should be structured:

#### Core Service Interface
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import List, Optional

from .models import CarData, SearchParameters

class ISearchService(ABC):
    """Interface for search services."""
    
    @abstractmethod
    def search_cars(self, params: SearchParameters) -> List[CarData]:
        """Search for cars based on the provided parameters."""
        pass
        
    @abstractmethod
    def get_recent_searches(self) -> List[SearchParameters]:
        """Get a list of recent searches."""
        pass
```

#### External Service Interface
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import List, Optional

from .models import CarData, SearchParameters

class ISearchProvider(ABC):
    """Interface for search providers."""
    
    @abstractmethod
    def execute_search(self, params: SearchParameters) -> List[CarData]:
        """Execute a search with the provided parameters."""
        pass
```

#### Implementation with Dependency Injection
```python
class SearchService(ISearchService):
    """Implementation of the search service."""
    
    def __init__(self, search_provider: ISearchProvider):
        """Initialize the search service with a search provider."""
        self.search_provider = search_provider
        self.recent_searches = []
        
    def search_cars(self, params: SearchParameters) -> List[CarData]:
        """Search for cars based on the provided parameters."""
        # Add to recent searches
        self.recent_searches.append(params)
        if len(self.recent_searches) > 10:
            self.recent_searches.pop(0)
            
        # Execute search via provider
        return self.search_provider.execute_search(params)
        
    def get_recent_searches(self) -> List[SearchParameters]:
        """Get a list of recent searches."""
        return self.recent_searches.copy()
```

## Verification

The recommended architecture meets the stated requirements:

1. **Modular Design**: The layered architecture with functional modules provides clear separation between UI, business logic, and external integrations.

2. **Extensibility**: The use of interfaces and dependency injection enables support for multiple data sources and LLM providers.

3. **Maintainability**: Well-defined interfaces between components make the system more maintainable.

4. **Configurability**: The configuration module provides external configuration for API keys and settings.

5. **Python & Qt6**: The architecture supports the use of Python for all logic and Qt6 for the UI.

6. **Cross-Platform**: The architecture is platform-independent and will work well on macOS and other platforms.

By following these guidelines, the Car Search application will have a solid architectural foundation that supports current requirements and future extensions.
