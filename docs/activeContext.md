# Active Context - Car Search Project

## Current Focus
- Completed planning phase, ready to transition to implementation
- Beginning project structure and environment setup
- Architecture design finalized and documented

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a smart car search assistant to help users find reliable used cars within their budget and location parameters. The application will search for cars in a defined area, compare their reliability using publicly available data, and help narrow down choices to the most reliable vehicles with high value for money.

## Key Requirements
- Search by postcode (UK) and radius
- Define min/max vehicle costs
- Optional filtering by make and drivetrain type
- Web scraping from AutoTrader
- Integration with car data APIs
- LLM integration for decision support
- Qt6-based user interface

## Technical Stack
- Python for backend logic
- Qt6 for user interface
- LLM integration (primarily Google Gemini)
- Web scraping capabilities
- Car data API integration

## Development Requirements
- All Python packages MUST be installed using UV, NOT pip
- Virtual environments should be managed with UV
- Follow modular architecture defined in architecture.md

## Architecture Highlights
- Modular architecture with three main layers:
  - UI Layer (Qt6 components)
  - Business Logic Layer (search, data, LLM management)
  - External Integration Layer (web scraping, APIs)
- Clean separation of concerns
- Extensible design supporting multiple data sources and LLM providers
- Configuration management for API keys and settings

## Current Status
- Completed planning phase
- Architecture design documented
- Implementation tasks defined
- Ready to begin project structure setup

## Next Steps
- Set up project structure following designed architecture
- Configure Python environment with required dependencies using UV
- Implement core application skeleton
- Begin UI development with Qt6
