# Car Search Project: Planning Document

## Requirements Analysis

### Core Requirements
- [ ] Create a user interface with Qt6 for entering search parameters
- [ ] Implement search functionality based on AutoTrader website
- [ ] Set up car data integration for reliability information
- [ ] Integrate with LLM (primarily Google Gemini) for decision support
- [ ] Support various filtering options (postcode, radius, price, make, drivetrain)

### Technical Constraints
- [ ] Python must be used for backend logic
- [ ] Qt6 must be used for the user interface
- [ ] Support integration with multiple LLM providers (priority on Google Gemini)
- [ ] Application must run on macOS (primary) with cross-platform compatibility in mind
- [ ] All Python packages MUST be installed and managed using UV, NOT pip

  - LLM module analyzes data and provides recommendations
  - Results displayed to user via UI

### UI/UX
- [ ] **Main Search Interface**
  - Form with fields for all search parameters
  - Clear validation and error handling
  - Modern Qt6 styling with intuitive layout

- [ ] **Results Display**
  - Sortable/filterable list of car search results
  - Detailed view for individual car information
  - Visual indicators for reliability scores

- [ ] **LLM Analysis Display**
  - Clear presentation of LLM recommendations
  - Options to refine or adjust search based on recommendations

### Algorithms
- [ ] **Search Algorithm**
  - Efficient web scraping with appropriate throttling
  - Caching to minimize redundant requests

- [ ] **Data Integration Algorithm**
  - Matching car listings with reliability data
  - Scoring system for reliability and value metrics

- [ ] **LLM Prompt Engineering**
  - Structured prompts for consistent and useful recommendations
  - Context management for multi-step interactions

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Setup and Core Structure

- [ ] Add configuration options for LLM providers

### Phase 3: Search Functionality
- [ ] Implement AutoTrader search URL construction
- [ ] Create web scraping functionality for search results
- [ ] Add result parsing and data extraction
- [ ] Implement caching and throttling mechanisms

### Phase 4: Car Data Integration
- [ ] Research and select appropriate car data APIs
- [ ] Implement API integration for reliability data
- [ ] Create data enrichment logic for search results
- [ ] Add scoring and comparison functionality

### Phase 5: LLM Integration
- [ ] Set up Google Gemini API connection
- [ ] Implement prompt engineering for car recommendations
- [ ] Create abstraction layer for multiple LLM providers
- [ ] Add result processing and display

### Phase 6: Testing and Refinement
- [ ] Implement comprehensive testing
- [ ] Refine user interface based on testing
- [ ] Optimize performance for web scraping and API calls
- [ ] Ensure cross-platform compatibility

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Test each module independently (UI, search, car data, LLM)
- [ ] Verify correct handling of edge cases and errors
- [ ] Mock external services for reliable testing

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Test interaction between modules
- [ ] Verify data flow through the entire application
- [ ] Test with simulated real-world scenarios

### UI Tests
